# Project 3 repo:

## Overview:
This repository is about a web app that is used to manage Internet-of-Thing devices in a office, these devices all have a function in the office and a system is needed to manage these devices. The devices can be part of 1 zone and 1 category. This web app allows you to add a new device, category and zone, you can also edit each of these tables as well as deleting an item from a table. I have also built in extra functionality to search for a item in a table, to sort the data in the tables as well as to get the most recently added item. All of this is accomplished within the web app, which is secured with a username and password. In order to access the tables you first have to log in or register if you have no login already. Once logged in you can access all of the tables and perform all of the actions.
## How to use the web app:
