Author: [Dennis Van Tonder](https://github.com/dennisvantonder/)
## Subject: IT Developments
The IT-environment changes at a fast pace. That is why we have a module with content regularly updated to keep up with newer developments in the IT-environment. The module is presented at the end of the degree to allow students to integrate their knowledge from other modules into this module. In the module, a series of projects are undertaken. Self-study and teamwork are important parts of these projects. These projects' goal is to expose the student to new IT challenges and appropriate technology to address these challenges. The development of soft skills is also part of the primary goal of this module.
## University project:
This was is a continuation on [Project 2](https://github.com/dennisvantonder/CMPG-323-Project-2-31609988), this web application uses the API created in Project 2 to get the data. Mark I recieved for this project: 98%
## Overview:
This repository is about a web app that is used to manage Internet-of-Thing devices in a office, these devices all have a function in the office and a system is needed to manage these devices. The devices can be part of 1 zone and 1 category. 

This web app allows you to add a new device, category and zone, you can also edit each of these tables as well as deleting an item from a table. I have also built in extra functionality to search for a item, to sort the data as well as to get the most recently added item. All of this is accomplished within the web app, which is secured with a username and password. In order to access the tables you first have to log in or register if you have no login already. Once logged in you can access all of the tables and perform all of the actions.
## How to use the web app:
